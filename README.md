## Problem Statement

**Ministry/Organization Name** - <a href="https://www.aicte-india.org/">AICTE</a>  

**Problem Statement** - An integrated annual academic
calendar for all the Indian universities


## Understanding The Problem Statement

- **Fewer options of
courses and colleges
available**
Students of those
Institutions who complete
their examinations and
get results early have the
opportunity to select the
course of their choice and
move to the University of
choice while those whose
results are declared late
have no (Or) less options
of courses and colleges
available for them

- **Huge cost and loss of
time to students in
their academic career**
Students also have to
travel to each of these
colleges to get
information, apply and get
admitted and so on. This
results in huge cost and
loss of time to students
in their academic career.
